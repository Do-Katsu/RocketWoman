# RocketWoman
## **Getting Started**

The project uses the following dependencies:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- matplotlib.widgets
- matplotlib.animation
- matplotlib.image
- matplotlib.offsetbox

Make sure these are installed before running the simulation.

To run the simulation, run the script 

```shell 
RocketWoman.py 
```

The script will prompt the user to choose between two display options:

- "yes" for a pre-drawn, non-editable simulation
- any other input for an editable simulation

## **How it works**

The simulation uses the equations of motion to calculate the altitude and velocity of the rocket as a function of time. The script also displays the rocket's trajectory and altitude and velocity as a function of time.

The simulation includes a threshold velocity, which if exceeded, will result in a successful landing. The landing velocity is also displayed.
